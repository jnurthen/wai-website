## Introduction

This road map describes the current and planned work to be accomplished by the ARIA Working Group. The targets found herein are based on the version of the relevant specification. In order to determine the intended delivery date, please see the [ARIA Project Plan](/about/groups/ariawg/planning/).


## Develop and Maintain Additional ARIA Features for Authors and End Users

The ARIA Working Group will continue developing, maintaining, and documenting ARIA features authors can use to make their content more accessible to end users. Much of this work will be done on an ad-hoc basis based on feedback from authors and implementors. As such, work in this area will not be itemized here unless it entails a significant amount of effort. Generally speaking, however, the Working Group will:

- Add and/or modify ARIA features based on feedback from authors (Target: Ongoing)
- Map new and modified features to platform accessibility APIs (Target: Ongoing)
- Update platform accessibility API mappings specifications maintained by this Working Group when the platform APIs change (Target: Ongoing)
- Write authoring guidance for new and modified features (Target: Ongoing)
- Collaborate with user agent implementors and assistive technology developers to maximize interoperability (Target: Ongoing)

Specific items that the Working Group plans to accomplish, which will entail a non-trivial amount of effort include:

- Add support for annotations (Target 1.3)
- Add additional Braille support (Target 1.3)

## Ensure Consistency in Platform Accessibility API Mappings

The Working Group believes a consistent (host-language-independent) user experience is desirable. The simplest way to achieve that is to ensure elements are exposed to assistive technologies in a consistent fashion regardless of the native host language chosen by the author. Exposure to assistive technologies is defined in the platform Accessibility API Mappings specifications, not all of which are developed and maintained by the ARIA Working Group. In order to maximize the likelihood of a consistent user experience, the Working Group will:

- Review Accessibility API Mapping specifications produced by other Working Groups (Target: Ongoing)
- Create and maintain solutions for automated accessibility API-based testing of the exposure of roles, states, and properties of elements in native host languages (Target: Ongoing)
- Identify host languages for which there are no associated Accessibility API Mappings specification and collaborate with the Working Group that maintains that language to determine what solution, if any, is appropriate (Target: Ongoing)
